Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows/Linux

Objective:

Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block traffic using Windows Firewall or UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux.

Tools Used:

Windows Firewall (for Windows users)

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) (for Linux users)

Implementation Steps:

Step 1: Open Firewall Configuration Tool

Windows: Control Panel → System and Security → Windows Defender Firewall

Linux: Use terminal command sudo ufw status

Step 2: List Current Firewall Rules
Command:

sudo ufw status numbered


Step 3: Add Rule to Block Port 23 (Telnet)
Command:

sudo ufw deny 23/tcp


Step 4: Test the Rule
Command:

telnet localhost 23


Result: Connection should fail, confirming that port 23 is blocked.

Step 5: Allow SSH (Port 22)
Command:

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp


Step 6: Remove the Test Block Rule
Command:

sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp


Step 7: Document Commands or GUI Steps Used
All commands and GUI steps are listed below.

Commands / GUI Steps Summary
Action	Linux Command / GUI Path
View firewall status	sudo ufw status
Block port 23 (Telnet)	sudo ufw deny 23/tcp
Allow SSH	sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
Delete test rule	sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp
Enable firewall	sudo ufw enable
Windows new inbound rule	wf.msc → Inbound Rules → New Rule → Port → Block
Firewall Configuration (Windows Example)

Screenshot 1: Windows Defender Firewall main window
Screenshot 2: Inbound rules view
Screenshot 3: Creating a new inbound rule (select Port)
Screenshot 4: Blocking specific local port 23 (Telnet)
Screenshot 5: Testing blocked port using Telnet command
Screenshot 6: Telnet command blocked confirmation message

How Firewall Filters Traffic:

A firewall monitors and controls network traffic based on predefined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

Inbound rules control traffic entering your system.

Outbound rules control traffic leaving your system.

Traffic can be filtered based on IP address, port number, or protocol (TCP/UDP).

Summary:

In this task, the Windows Defender Firewall was configured to block incoming traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
A test connection attempt using the Telnet command confirmed that the connection was denied.
After verification, the rule can be removed or disabled to restore normal connectivity.

Outcome:

Successfully applied inbound firewall rules.

Tested network port blocking (Telnet).

Gained understanding of firewall-based traffic filtering in Windows.
